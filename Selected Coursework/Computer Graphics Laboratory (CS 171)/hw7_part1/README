Description of the program:
This directory creates a program that renders and displays a scene using OpenGL,
and allows the user to add primitives (superquadric) and objects to the scene,
load scene .scn files, test detecting whether points are within the displayed
primitives, and test intersections with objects. The scene can be rotated with
an Arcball mouse UI.

Compiling the program:
In this directory, open the terminal and type make to compile the program.
This directory's Makefile creates an executable file named modeler.

Executing the program: The usage statement for the program is stated below.
Also, the executable program generated after running make in this directory can
be run in the terminal and will display a usage statement to show how the
program should be run if specified with no command line arguments.

Using make clean will delete the executable file in this directory.

Usage statement ($ represents terminal command line):
$ ./modeler
Usage: ./modeler xres yres

Description of the program:
This directory creates a program that renders and displays a scene using OpenGL,
and allows the user to add primitives (superquadric) and objects to the scene,
load scene .scn files, test detecting whether points are within the displayed
primitives, test intersections with objects, and raytrace scenes. The scene can
be rotated with an Arcball mouse UI.

Note 1: For attenuation in the Phong lighting model, a parameter was made to
make the scenes brighter (see the lighting function in Assignment.cpp)

Note 2: To get rid of numerical errors involving shadowing, a parameter was
empirically determined an utilized to get rid of shadowing errors (where random
points resulted with dark colors even though they were not behind any other
primitives between the points and the light in the scene) (see the is_in_shadow
function in Assignment.cpp).

Note 3: The three current .png images in the src directory were generated by the
raytracing program in Assignment.cpp.

Compiling the program:
In this directory, open the terminal and type make to compile the program.
This directory's Makefile creates an executable file named modeler.

Executing the program: The usage statement for the program is stated below.
Also, the executable program generated after running make in this directory can
be run in the terminal and will display a usage statement to show how the
program should be run if specified with no command line arguments.

Using make clean will delete the executable file in this directory.

Usage statement ($ represents terminal command line):
$ ./modeler
Usage: ./modeler xres yres

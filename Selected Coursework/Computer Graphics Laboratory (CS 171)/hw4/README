Note:
Due to file size constraints, the armadillo.obj file was removed from the
part1/data directory.

Descriptions of the programs:
The directory part1 contains the program for rendering scenes using either
Gouraud shading or Phong shading, and the directory part2 contains the program
for rendering a texture with normal mapping. Both scenes can be rotated with an
Arcball mouse UI.

Compiling the programs:
In each directory, open the terminal and type make to compile the respective
program. Both directories' Makefiles create an executable file named
glsl_renderer.

Executing the programs: The usage statements for both programs are stated below.
Also, both executable programs generated after running make in each directory
can be run in the terminal and each will display a usage statement to show how
the program should be run if specified with no command line arguments.

Click and drag on the scene to rotate the scene using the Arcball mouse UI.

Using make clean will delete the executable in the respective directory.

Usage statements ($ represents terminal command line):
part1:
$ ./glsl_renderer
Usage: ./glsl_renderer [scene_description_file.txt] [xres] [yres] [mode]

part2:
$ ./glsl_renderer
Usage: ./glsl_renderer [color_texture.png] [normal_map.png]

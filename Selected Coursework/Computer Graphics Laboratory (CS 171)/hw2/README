Compiling the program:
In this directory, open the terminal and type make to compile the program.

Executing the programs: The usage statement for the program is stated below.
Also, the executable program generated after running make in this directory can
be run in the terminal and will display a usage statement to show how the
program should be run if specified with no command line arguments.

To generate all the scene images using Gouraud shading, run make g_images.
To generate all the scene images using Phong shading, run make p_images.

Using make clean will delete the executable and any .png images in the
directory.

Usage statement ($ represents terminal command line):
$ ./shaded_renderer
Usage: ./shaded_renderer [scene_description_file.txt] [xres] [yres] [mode]
mode == 0 => Gouraud shading
mode == 1 => Phong shading
Add " | display -" after [yres] to directly display the PPM image
Add " | convert - my_image_name.png " after [yres] to convert the PPM image into
 a PNG image.

The explanation of the generalized Bresenham's line algorithm is located just
above the bresenham function, where the algorithm is used, starting at line 26
in the file wireframe_renderer.cpp.

Compiling the program:
In this directory, open the terminal and type make to compile each program.

Executing the programs: The usage statement for the program is stated below.
Also, the executable program generated after running make in this directory can
be run in the terminal and will display a usage statement to show how the
program should be run if specified with no command line arguments.

Usage statements for each folder ($ represents terminal command line):
Part1:
$ ./wireframe_renderer
Usage: ./wireframe_renderer [scene_description_file.txt] [xres] [yres]
Add " | display -" after [yres] to directly display the PPM image
Add " | convert - my_image_name.png " after [yres] to convert the PPM image into
 a PNG image.

Descriptions of the program features:
This program has two major features:
1. Renders 3D triangle mesh models (.obj files) in the art style of the
   video game Team Fortress 2 as detailed by Mitchell, J., Francke, M.,
   and Eng, D. 2007. This program utilizes a variety of techniques such
   as texture-mapped diffuse lighting and rim lighting.

2. Animates a 2-dimensional heightmap (triangle mesh sheet oriented
   along the xy-plane) with any given time-dependent function of 2
   variables (e.g. h = f(t; x, y)).

Compiling the programs:
In the project directory, open the terminal and type "make" to compile the
program. This should create an executable file named "glsl_renderer".

Executing the programs: Run glsl_renderer with appropriate command line
arguments, as shown by initially running glsl_renderer with no additional
arguments.

Click and drag on the scene to rotate the scene using the Arcball mouse UI.

Using make clean will delete the executable in the respective directory.
